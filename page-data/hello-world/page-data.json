The purpose of unit testing is to create a robust codebase. This also allows to identify the defects very early in the software lifecycle (Shift Left). Unit Tests makes up the largest section of the pyramid, therefore creating a sold base.</p>\n<p>E2E tests are typically slow because they run against the GUI, interacting with the real server, acting like a real user. They need a working application. That’s why E2E tests are not feasible to be used as the only/main test type. They are pretty important because they are testing everything but they must be used carefully to avoid brittle and time consuming test suites.</p>\n<p>Having no or fewer unit tests &#x26; more E2E tests is an anti-pattern.
